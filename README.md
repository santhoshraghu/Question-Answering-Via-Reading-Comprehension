# Question-Answering-Via-Reading-Comprehension
Question Answering Via Reading Comprehension on Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD)


### Overview:
In this Project, I had the opportunity to design and implement a question-answering model using an NLP + Deep Learning approach. The task involved utilizing the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD), which consists of questions posed on a set of Wikipedia articles, with the answers being segments of text from the corresponding reading passages or indicating that the question is unanswerable.

### Completion Summary:
- **Implemented a question-answering model**
  - Utilized the official evaluation script to report the final F1 score of the model.
  - Successfully implemented a question-answering model based on the provided tutorial and relevant resources.
  - Achieved a competitive F1 score for the model.

- **Unanswerable question detection**
  - Proposed a model for detecting unanswerable questions using binary classification.
  - Outlined the hypothesis, motivation, model design, and key parameter settings for the proposed model.
  - Did not implement the model but provided a detailed design and approach.

- **LangChain practice**
  - Reviewed the LangChain documentation.
  - Implemented two sequential chain structures.
  - Designed and implemented a custom sequential chain structure, analyzed the results, and provided a diagram of the design.
